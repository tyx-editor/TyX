Settings
========

TyX settings let you customize your app-wide experience.

This includes the UI language, your keyboard shortcuts, your math inline shortcuts, and optionally your keyboard map.

You can save or edit this file in the TyX data directory.
By opening TyX and saving the settings you can see this path.
.. tip::
    You can also create this settings file and then TyX will automatically read and use it!

.. warning::
    TyX is still in early development and thus the default keyboard shortcuts might undergo breaking changes, in which case you should reset to the new defaults!
