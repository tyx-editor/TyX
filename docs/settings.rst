Settings
========

TyX settings let you customize your app-wide experience.

This includes the UI language, your keyboard shortcuts, your math inline shortcuts, and optionally your keyboard map.

.. warning::
    TyX is still in early development and thus the default keyboard shortcuts might undergo breaking changes, in which case you should reset to the new defaults!
