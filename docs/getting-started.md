# Getting Started

## Installation

To install TyX, you can go to [tyx-editor.com](https://tyx-editor.com).

Alternatively, you can download the installer for your operating system from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/tyx-editor/TyX/releases).

## Using TyX

TyX is intended for two types of users:

- Users who simply wish to easily edit documents and have them look good, without diving too deep.
- Power users who hack TyX and create nice configurations (for their language, institution, etc.).

For power users, it is recommended to read the [Configuration](./configuration.md) section for the various ways to create setups for TyX.
